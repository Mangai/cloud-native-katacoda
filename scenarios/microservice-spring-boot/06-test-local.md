Using Spring Boot maven plugin, you can conveniently run the application locally and test the endpoint.

```
mvn spring-boot:run
```{{execute T1}}

When you see **Started CatalogApplication** in the logs, you can access the 
Catalog REST API. Letâ€™s test it out using `curl` in a new terminal window:

```
curl http://localhost:9000/api/catalog
```{{execute T2}}

You should see a result like:

```
[{"itemId":"329299","name":"Red Fedora","desc":"Official Red Hat Fedora","price":34.99},...]
```

The REST API returned a JSON object representing the product list. Congratulations!

Stop the service by pressing **CTRL-C** in the first terminal window or clicking on 
the following:

`clear`{{execute T1 interrupt}}
