Using WildFly Swarm maven plugin, you can conveniently run the application locally and test the endpoint.

```
mvn wildfly-swarm:run
```{{execute T1}}

Alternatively, you can run the application using the uber-jar produced 
during the Maven build: 

```java -jar target/inventory-1.0-SNAPSHOT-swarm.jar```

Once you see **WildFly Swarm is Ready** in the logs, the Inventory service is up and running and you can access the 
inventory REST API. Letâ€™s test it out using `curl` in a new terminal window. 

You can open an new terminal window by clicking on the plus (+) icon on the terminal toolbar and then 
choose **Open New Terminal**. You can also click on the following command to automatically open a new 
terminal:

```
curl http://localhost:9001/api/inventory/329299
```{{execute T2}}

You would see a JSON response like this:
```
{"itemId":"329299","quantity":35}
```

The REST API returned a JSON object representing the inventory count for this product. Congratulations!

Stop the service by pressing **CTRL-C** in the first terminal window or clicking on 
the following:

`clear`{{execute T1 interrupt}}
